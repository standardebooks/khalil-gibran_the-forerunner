			<p>And as the man walked home with his money he thought, and he said to himself, “How much life this money means! How can anyone give all this for a dead carved stone buried and undreamed of in the earth for a thousand years?”</p>
			<p>And now the collector was looking at his statue, and he was thinking, and he said to himself, “What beauty! What life! The dream of what a soul!⁠—and fresh with the sweet sleep of a thousand years. How can anyone give all this for money, dead and dreamless?”</p>
