			<h2 epub:type="title">Poets</h2>
			<p>Four poets were sitting around a bowl of punch that stood on a table.</p>
			<p>Said the first poet, “Methinks I see with my third eye the fragrance of this wine hovering in space like a cloud of birds in an enchanted forest.”</p>
			<p>The second poet raised his head and said, “With my inner ear I can hear those mist-birds singing. And the melody holds my heart as the white rose imprisons the bee within her petals.”</p>
			<p>The third poet closed his eyes and stretched his arm upward, and said, “I touch them with my hand. I feel their wings, like the breath of a sleeping fairy, brushing against my fingers.”</p>
			<p>Then the fourth poet rose and lifted up the bowl, and he said, “Alas, friends! I am too dull of sight and of hearing and of touch. I cannot see the fragrance of this wine, nor hear its song, nor feel the beating of its wings. I perceive but the wine itself. Now therefore must I drink it, that it may sharpen my senses and raise me to your blissful heights.”</p>
			<p>And putting the bowl to his lips, he drank the punch to the very last drop.</p>
			<p>The three poets, with their mouths open, looked at him aghast, and there was a thirsty yet unlyrical hatred in their eyes.</p>
