			<h2 epub:type="title">The King of Aradus</h2>
			<p>Once the elders of the city of Aradus presented themselves before the king, and besought of him a decree to forbid to men all wine and all intoxicants within their city.</p>
			<p>And the king turned his back upon them and went out from them laughing.</p>
			<p>Then the elders departed in dismay.</p>
			<p>At the door of the palace they met the lord chamberlain. And the lord chamberlain observed that they were troubled, and he understood their case.</p>
			<p>Then he said, “Pity, my friends! Had you found the king drunk, surely he would have granted you your petition.”</p>
