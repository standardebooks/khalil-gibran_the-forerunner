			<h2 epub:type="title">The Saint</h2>
			<p>In my youth I once visited a saint in his silent grove beyond the hills; and as we were conversing upon the nature of virtue a brigand came limping wearily up the ridge. When he reached the grove he knelt down before the saint and said, “O saint, I would be comforted! My sins are heavy upon me.”</p>
			<p>And the saint replied, “My sins, too, are heavy upon me.”</p>
			<p>And the brigand said, “But I am a thief and a plunderer.”</p>
			<p>And the saint replied, “I too am a thief and a plunderer.”</p>
			<p>And the brigand said, “But I am a murderer, and the blood of many men cries in my ears.”</p>
			<p>And the saint replied, “I too am a murderer, and in my ears cries the blood of many men.”</p>
			<p>And the brigand said, “I have committed countless crimes.”</p>
			<p>And the saint replied, “I too have committed crimes without number.”</p>
			<p>Then the brigand stood up and gazed at the saint, and there was a strange look in his eyes. And when he left us he went skipping down the hill.</p>
			<p>And I turned to the saint and said, “Wherefore did you accuse yourself of uncommitted crimes? See you not that this man went away no longer believing in you?”</p>
			<p>And the saint answered, “It is true he no longer believes in me. But he went away much comforted.”</p>
			<p>At that moment we heard the brigand singing in the distance, and the echo of his song filled the valley with gladness.</p>
