			<p>Said a sheet of snow-white paper, “Pure was I created, and pure will I remain forever. I would rather be burnt and turn to white ashes than suffer darkness to touch me or the unclean to come near me.”</p>
			<p>The ink-bottle heard what the paper was saying, and it laughed in its dark heart; but it never dared to approach her. And the multicoloured pencils heard her also, and they too never came near her.</p>
			<p>And the snow-white sheet of paper did remain pure and chaste forever⁠—pure and chaste⁠—and empty.</p>
